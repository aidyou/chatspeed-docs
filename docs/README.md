## 🌟 What can Chatspeed do?
- **💼 Multi-functional Desktop Assistant**: Use it for translation, creating mind maps, flowcharts, daily conversations, and more. Quickly summon it with the shortcut ALT+Z.
- **🔌 Connect Any Dev Tool**: Beyond just [Claude Code](./ccproxy/claude-code.md), you can connect your models to almost any major AI development tool, including [Gemini CLI](./ccproxy/gemini.md), [Cline](./ccproxy/cline.md), [Roo Code](./ccproxy/roo-code.md), and [Zed](./ccproxy/zed.md).
- **💰 Use Claude Code for Free**: As a best practice, we provide a detailed tutorial on how to [use Claude Code for free](./posts/claude-code-free/).
- **🚀 MCP Hub**: Chatspeed's MCP proxy can provide its own `WebSearch` and `WebFetch` tools, along with any `MCP` tools you've installed, to external clients via the Streamable HTTP protocol. Learn how to [centrally manage MCP](/mcp/).

## 🚀 Universal AI Proxy `CCProxy`

`CCProxy` (`Chat Completion Proxy`) is Chatspeed's core proxy engine, a universal adapter designed for AI development. It primarily solves two major pain points:

### 1. Protocol Conversion for Cost-Efficiency
It enables arbitrary protocol conversion between OpenAI-compatible formats, Gemini, Claude, Ollama, and more. This means you can seamlessly integrate any local or cloud-based free, open-source, or cost-effective model into popular development environments like `Claude Code` and `Gemini CLI` that require specific protocols.

**✨ Special Feature: Tool Calling Compatibility Mode**

For models that do not natively support tool calling (Function Calling), `CCProxy` provides a compatibility mode, allowing them to understand and execute tool calling instructions, greatly expanding their capabilities.

### 2. Unified Entry Point for Streamlined Workflow
It aggregates all MCP tools (e.g., web browsing, file operations) installed on Chatspeed into a single, unified proxy entry point for external service. Configure once, and all applications and terminals can call them, completely eliminating repetitive setup.

> You can access `CCProxy`'s MCP via Streamable HTTP at `http://localhost:11435/mcp/http`

### Key Benefits

- **🔀 Seamless Protocol Conversion**: Efficiently convert between mainstream AI protocols, achieving a "universal" adaptation effect.
- **💰 Ultimate Cost Control**: Flexibly use free and cost-effective models, making "using Claude Code for free" a reality.
- **🔄 Configure Once, Use Everywhere**: Eliminate the tedious, repetitive configuration of MCP tools across multiple IDEs, boosting development efficiency.
- **🎯 Flexible Group Switching**: Efficiently use AI-assisted programming in different scenarios through various model groups.
- **🔑 Enhanced Security**: Use `CCProxy`'s proxy key to effectively isolate clients from real keys, ensuring your AI account security.
- **🚀 High Performance**: A high-performance adapter implemented in Rust, ensuring stability and reliability.
