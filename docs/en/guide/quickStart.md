# Quick Start

This guide will help you get familiar with the basic features of Chatspeed in 5 minutes.

## 1. Start Chatting

After installing Chatspeed, you will find that we have built in a free AI provider, [Pollinations](https://pollinations.ai/). This platform offers many free AI models, and we have integrated the following by default: openai, openai-fast (ChatGPT-4o-mini), and openai-roblox (ChatGPT-4o-mini). You can also add other models as needed; see the next section for details.

### Adding a Model

We will use the Pollinations platform as an example to detail how to add a new model. During the process, please pay close attention to the numbered annotations in the example images.

1.  Click the **Menu** button in the top-right corner of the Chatspeed main window, then select **AI Engines**. Please follow the steps indicated by the numbers in the image below:

## 2. Assistant
After installing Chatspeed, the assistant has no skills by default. To give the assistant more capabilities, you need to add skills. You can bring up the assistant interface with the hotkey `option+z` (or `alt+z` on Windows).
