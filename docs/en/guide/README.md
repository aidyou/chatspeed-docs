### 1. AI Proxies

An AI proxy is the basic management unit in Chatspeed. Each proxy represents a specific AI model configuration, including:

- Model provider and specific model
- API key and access endpoint
- Parameter configuration (temperature, max tokens, etc.)

### 2. Model Groups

Model groups allow you to organize multiple AI proxies together, making it easy to:

- Categorize by use case (e.g., programming, translation, writing)
- Quickly switch models for different scenarios
- Centrally manage parameter settings for similar tasks

### 3. ccproxy Proxy

`ccproxy` is Chatspeed's core proxy engine, responsible for:

- Converting between different AI protocols (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, Ollama, etc.)
- Providing a unified API access point
- Enabling "Any Claude Code, Any Gemini CLI" capabilities

### 4. MCP Tools

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools extend the capabilities of AI, including:

- File system access
- Database queries
- Web searches
- Git operations, and more.
