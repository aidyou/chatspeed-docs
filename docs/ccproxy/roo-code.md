# `Roo Code` Integration Guide

[Roo Code](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code) is a fork of [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) and an excellent `VS Code` **AI plugin**. It efficiently handles tedious tasks, such as filling in missing `i18n` language items for `Chatspeed` or performing information verification by installing necessary `MCP` tools.

The following explains how to configure `CCProxy`'s proxy models in `Roo Code`, using the addition of `gemini2.5-pro` as an example.

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have completed the following steps:

1. Installed [Chatspeed](../guide/installation.md)
2. Added the necessary models according to the [Quick Start](../guide/quickStart.md)
3. Completed the [CCProxy Basic Configuration](configuration.md)
4. Added the required proxy models
5. Configured the proxy keys

> For the `Roo Code` plugin, the model is specified by the user, so configuring a **Proxy Group** is not a necessary condition.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuring `Roo Code`

1.  Open the Roo Code model settings in the order indicated by the numbers in the image, enter `gemini2.5-pro`, and then click `Create Profile` to save.

2.  Click in the order indicated by the numbers, enter the relevant information, and then click the `Save` button marked as **number 6** to save the information.
    - **API Provider**: Select `OpenAI Compatible`.
    - **Base URL**: Enter `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1`.
    - **API Key**: Copy the proxy key from the CCProxy settings interface and paste it here.
    - **Model**: Select `gemini2.5-pro`.
    - `gemini2.5-pro` supports image input and tool calling, so you can check the corresponding options or ignore them.

3.  Roo Code supports creating multiple models. You can add other models by repeating the first and second steps. Finally, return to the `Roo Code` plugin's main interface to start using it.
